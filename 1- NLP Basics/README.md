# NLP Basics
NLP basics include the most popular libraries in natural language processing (NLTK - Spacy - re - FastText - Genism)

Handling text files (Read - Write) is important for text processing. 

PDF files are widely used in all fields so we need to learn how to read, write and merge files.

A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern. To do opertions like text search we need to use re library.
